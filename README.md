# Use CloudAMQP in Java from Heroku

This project illustrates how to use the [Java client AMQP library]() to access [CloudAMQP](http://www.cloudamqp.com) from [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).

It consists of one [worker](https://github.com/cloudamqp/java-amqp-example/blob/master/src/main/java/WorkerProcess.java) which listens to a queue and prints the messages to the console (and thus to the Heroku log), and a ["oneoff" process](https://github.com/cloudamqp/java-amqp-example/blob/master/src/main/java/WorkerProcess.java) which enqeues messages to that queue.

For more information on AMQP and how to use it from Java, see [RabbitMQ's tutorial](http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).

## Usage

The targeted JAVA version is 8 and the project can be packaged with Maven using:
mvn clean package

In order to run locally, start two terminals and in the first run:
java -cp target/amqpexample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar WorkerProcess

In the other, execute:
java -cp target/amqpexample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar OneOffProcess

in order to publish messages to the Worker.

Make sure you have the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed. Scale the worker process, start the one-off process that enqueues messages and then inspect the log:

    $ heroku ps:scale worker=1 -a your-app-name

    $ heroku run "sh target/bin/oneoff" -a your-app-name
    Running sh target/bin/oneoff attached to terminal... up, run.1
     [x] Sent 'Hello CloudAMQP!'

    $ heroku logs -a your-app-name
